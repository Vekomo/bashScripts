# bashScripts
Time saving misc bash scripts

- done.sh - I strongly dislike icons on my desktop. 
  In order to incentivize myself to get assignments done I put my files on the desktop.
  Then once I'm done I put them away according to the prefix I give them.
  This script automates the putting away of the files according to the prefix.
